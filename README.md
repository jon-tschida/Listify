### About

Listify was made to make creating grocery lists easier. 

To get started, create a new a new meal by clicking the "+" sign in left box with the "Meals" title. This will open another section for you to create your meal. In this area, you can give your meal a title and ingredients. Once you have your meal titled and ingredients added, click the "Add meal" to add it to your meal lists.

Now that you have some meals created, just click or tap any of the meals, and the ingredients will be added to your grocery list!

No more thinking through your meals for the week and what you need to shop for, just Listify them!

### Purpose for creating:

This was my second React project to date, it was quite a bit more ambitious than I initially thought it would be. But the whole goal of this application was to solve I problem I had, creating grocery lists.

### What I learned:

There was a considerable amount of state to keep track of, but I kept the majority of state in the "App" level, so we have one source of truth and then it can be passed down to children components. I learned quite a bit on the importance of detailed state variable names, it can get confusing quick! 

This really helped strengthen my understanding of conditional rendering, I hadn't utilized modals in past projets too much, so creating an app where forms were popping in and out depening on user interation was a new experience, but I do feel like this is my first, truly interactive web app, I'm quite proud of it! 

Also, we learned quite a bit more about how to utilize the higher order function `map()` to render out state in different ways in components. This wasn't a new concept, but it felt good to solidify that knowledge!
